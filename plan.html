<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan</h1>
<h1>Diazepam Cafe </h1>
<p>Group 7</p>
<p><strong>Mission  Statement</strong><br />
  The Diazepam Café website is  intended to increase revenue by promoting the products and services offered by  the café and increase the number of repeat customers. </p>
<p><strong>Success  Evaluation</strong><br />
  Other advertising will be  consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so  that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of  this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted  and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br />
  Local residents, mostly  teenagers, young adults and parents (who have young children). This will be the  target audience of the website aimed.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong><br />
  This section should contain  a dot-point list of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on<br />
  each of those pages. Use a  table or nested list or something clear. Create the flowchart from this.</p>
