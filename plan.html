<p><strong>Mission  Statement</strong><br />
  The Diazepam Café website is  intended to increase revenue by promoting the products and services offered by  the café and increase the number of repeat customers. </p>
<p><strong>Success  Evaluation</strong><br />
  Other advertising will be  consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so  that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of  this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted  and compared to the previous 3 months. Also, the bounce rate can be counted to check how many people are interested in knowing the website.</p>
